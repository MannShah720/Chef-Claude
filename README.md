# Chef Claude

## A recipe maker app that takes in ingredients written by the user and Claude gives a recipe

The app was built with the help of Scrimba.
The user types in ingredients and then the Claude AI develops a recipe from those ingredients.


From this project, I learnt about...

State:
- useState
- updating state using a callback function
- ternary
- toggling state
- arrays as a state
- objects as a state

Forms in React:
- event.preventDefault()
- event.currentTarget()
- FormData()
- Form action in react

State & Props:
- More conditional rendering practice
- Passing state as props
- Setting state from child components
- Shared state
