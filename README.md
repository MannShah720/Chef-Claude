# Getting Started
Install the dependencies and run the project
```
npm install
npm start
```

I've learnt about:

# State
- useState
- updating state using a callback function
- ternary
- toggling state
- arrays as a state
- objects as a state

# Forms in React
- event.preventDefault()
- event.currentTarget()
- FormData()
- Form action in react

# State & Props
- More conditional rendering practice
- Passing state as props
- Setting state from child components
- Shared state
