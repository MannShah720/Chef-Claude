# Chef Bot

## A recipe maker app that takes in ingredients and makes a recipe

The app was built with the help of Scrimba.
The user types in ingredients and then the Hugging Face AI develops a recipe from those ingredients.


From this project, I've learnt about...

State:
- Event listeners
- Using `useState`
- Updating state using a callback function
- Conditional rendering using ternary and `&&`
- Toggling state
- Arrays as a state
- Objects as a state

Forms in React:
- event.preventDefault()
- event.currentTarget()
- FormData()
- Form action in react

State & Props:
- More conditional rendering practice
- Passing state as props
- Setting state from child components
- Shared state
- Managing where state should be held
